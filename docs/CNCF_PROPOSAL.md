# Deployah: CNCF Sandbox Project Proposal

## Project Information

- **Project Name**: Deployah
- **Project Description**: A CLI tool that simplifies application deployment using Helm without requiring Kubernetes or Helm expertise
- **Primary Language**: Go
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Repository**: https://github.com/deployah-dev/deployah
- **Website**: https://deployah.dev (planned)
- **Contact**: maintainers@deployah.dev

## Problem Statement

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, but its complexity remains a significant barrier to adoption for many developers and organizations. While Helm provides a powerful package manager for Kubernetes, it still requires deep understanding of:

- Kubernetes resource types and configurations
- Helm chart structure and templating
- Cluster-specific configurations and best practices
- Environment-specific deployment strategies

This complexity results in:
- **Slow adoption**: Teams spend months learning Kubernetes before productive deployment
- **Configuration errors**: Manual YAML editing leads to deployment failures
- **Inconsistent practices**: Different teams develop different deployment patterns
- **Vendor lock-in**: Teams become dependent on specific tools or platforms
- **Security risks**: Misconfigured deployments expose applications to vulnerabilities

## Solution

Deployah addresses these challenges by providing a simplified, developer-friendly interface for Kubernetes deployments that:

1. **Abstracts Complexity**: Hides Kubernetes and Helm complexity behind a simple YAML configuration
2. **Provides Sensible Defaults**: Offers pre-configured deployment patterns for common application types
3. **Ensures Consistency**: Standardizes deployment practices across teams and organizations
4. **Enables Security**: Built-in validation and security best practices
5. **Supports Portability**: Works across any Kubernetes distribution

### Key Features

- **Simple Configuration**: Single YAML file with environment-specific overrides
- **Multi-Phase Pipeline**: 8-phase deployment process with validation at each step
- **Variable Substitution**: Clear precedence rules for configuration management
- **Environment Management**: Explicit environment selection with validation
- **Helm Integration**: Leverages Helm's power while hiding its complexity
- **Validation**: JSON Schema validation with clear error messages

## Technical Architecture

```

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Parse**: Read and validate YAML manifest structure
2. **Validate**: Check against JSON Schema for correctness
3. **Resolve Environment**: Select appropriate environment configuration
4. **Substitute Variables**: Replace variables using clear precedence rules
5. **Apply Defaults**: Fill in sensible defaults from schema patterns
6. **Generate Helm Values**: Convert to Helm-compatible format
7. **Deploy**: Use Helm to deploy with monitoring and error handling

### Integration with CNCF Ecosystem

Deployah integrates with several CNCF projects:

- **Helm**: Core dependency for Kubernetes package management
- **Kubernetes**: Target platform for deployments
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection (planned)
- **Fluentd**: Log aggregation (planned)
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing (planned)

## Use Cases

### 1. Developer Onboarding

**Scenario**: New developers joining a team need to deploy applications quickly
**Solution**: Deployah provides a simple configuration that works out of the box
**Benefit**: Reduced time to first deployment from weeks to hours

### 2. Microservices Deployment

**Scenario**: Teams managing multiple microservices with different configurations
**Solution**: Standardized deployment patterns with environment-specific overrides
**Benefit**: Consistent deployment practices across all services

### 3. Multi-Environment Management

**Scenario**: Applications need to be deployed across dev, staging, and production
**Solution**: Environment-specific configurations with validation
**Benefit**: Prevents accidental deployments to wrong environments

### 4. Legacy Application Migration

**Scenario**: Traditional applications being migrated to Kubernetes
**Solution**: Simplified deployment interface that abstracts Kubernetes complexity
**Benefit**: Faster migration with reduced risk
