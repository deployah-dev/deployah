# Governance

This document outlines the governance structure for the Deployah project.

## Project Overview

Deployah is a CLI tool that simplifies application deployment using Helm without requiring Kubernetes or Helm expertise. The project aims to make cloud-native deployments accessible to developers of all skill levels.

## Governance Model

Deployah follows a meritocratic governance model where contributors earn influence through their contributions to the project. The project is led by maintainers who are responsible for the overall direction and health of the project.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Setting the overall direction and vision for the project
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Maintaining code quality and project health
- Making release decisions
- Representing the project in the community

#### Current Maintainers

- [Maintainer names will be added here]

#### Becoming a Maintainer

To become a maintainer:
1. Demonstrate sustained contributions to the project
2. Show technical expertise in relevant areas
3. Exhibit good judgment and communication skills
4. Be nominated by existing maintainers
5. Receive approval from the majority of existing maintainers

### Contributors

Contributors are anyone who contributes to the project through:
- Code contributions
- Documentation
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Community support

All contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Decision Making

### Technical Decisions

Technical decisions are made through:
1. **RFC Process**: Major changes require a Request for Comments (RFC)
2. **Pull Request Reviews**: All code changes require maintainer approval
3. **Community Discussion**: Important decisions are discussed in GitHub Issues and Discussions

### RFC Process

For significant changes:
1. Create an RFC issue with the `rfc` label
2. Provide detailed proposal including:
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Alternatives considered
   - Implementation plan
   - Migration strategy (if applicable)
3. Allow for community feedback (minimum 2 weeks)
4. Maintainers make final decision based on community input

### Release Process

Releases follow semantic versioning:
- **Major releases** (x.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor releases** (0.x.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch releases** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, backward compatible

Release decisions are made by maintainers based on:
- Feature completeness
- Stability and testing
- Community needs
- Breaking change impact

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General discussion and questions
- **GitHub Pull Requests**: Code contributions
- **Security Issues**: security@deployah.dev

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts are resolved through:
1. Direct communication between parties
2. Mediation by maintainers if needed
3. Community discussion for unresolved issues
4. Final decision by maintainers if consensus cannot be reached

## Project Health

The project's health is measured by:
- **Code Quality**: Test coverage, linting, security scanning
- **Community Engagement**: Active contributors, issue response time
- **Adoption**: Downloads, usage metrics, community feedback
- **Documentation**: Completeness and accuracy

## CNCF Alignment

As a project aspiring to join CNCF, Deployah follows CNCF principles:
- **Open Source**: All code is open source under Apache 2.0
- **Vendor Neutral**: No vendor lock-in or proprietary dependencies
- **Community Driven**: Decisions made by the community, not single vendors
- **Transparent**: All discussions and decisions are public

## Future Governance

As the project grows, governance may evolve to include:
- Technical Steering Committee
- Working Groups for specific areas
- More formalized decision-making processes
- Additional maintainer roles

Changes to governance require:
1. RFC process for major changes
2. Community discussion and feedback
3. Approval by maintainers
4. Documentation updates

## Contact

For governance-related questions, contact the maintainers through:
- GitHub Issues with the `governance` label
- Direct communication with maintainers
- Community discussions
